## Packaging Component Libraries | Angular CLI

"The Angular CLI makes bootstrapping an app dead simple. But what about component libraries that need to be distributed as packages? In today’s JavaScript landscape, developers will consume packages in many different ways—some may use SystemJS or Webpack, others might consume packages in Node or maybe in the browser as a UMD bundle. The Angular Package Format supports all of the commonly used development tools and workflows and adds emphasis on optimizations that result either in smaller application payload size or faster development iteration cycle (build time). While support for building packages in this format is on the Angular CLI roadmap, it is not available today. We will look at a community-supported alternative, ng-packagr, that can be used today to build redistributable component libraries while retaining the benefits of the CLI for building demo and documentation apps in the same codebase." - BrieBug Software Solutions
